<h1>U.S. States Game</h1>

This Python script uses the Turtle graphics library to create an interactive game that quizzes the user on the names of U.S. states. The game presents a map of the United States with blank state names and prompts the user to type in the names of states. 

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 25.
